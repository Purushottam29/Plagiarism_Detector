# PD by puru — Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for "PD by puru" — a plagiarism detection UI built with Next.js.

## Overview

The frontend is standalone and no longer connected to v0.app or Vercel deployment badges.

## Local Development

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install    # or `npm install`
pnpm dev        # or `npm run dev`
```

## Notes

- The project name and Vercel/v0 deployment references were removed and replaced with "PD by puru".
- If you use CI/CD or a platform other than Vercel, update your deployment settings as needed.
