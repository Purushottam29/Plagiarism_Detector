    "Recent commercial systems show that they fail dramatically in performance, the quality decreases by up to 45% on multi-modal input, and the failure rates become high, up to 73% on AI generated content.",
    "This paper gives a comprehensive overview of these constraints and talks of an integrated seven step multi-modal plagiarism detection framework.",
    "It is proposed to use a combination of deep learning-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) architecture to allow analyzing texts, scans, and handwritten documents in a comprehensive manner.",
    "A hybrid similarity analysis methodology based on a combination of lexical, semantic and structure-oriented features enhance resistance to paraphrasing and automated generation.",
    "To be extensible, the system must be designed to achieve over 95% of detection and lowering the false positives when compared to the current systems.",
    "Defining the future-oriented architecture and defining the critical research gaps, the research opens the path to the next generation of academic integrity systems which would accommodate the changing needs of AI-enhanced plagiarism.",
    "CONTENTS\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 \u00a0Background and Motivation\nDigital transformation in education has not only brought about a revolution in the sharing of knowledge, it has also gotten to present new challenges on academic integrity.",
    "Plagiarism has taken many new forms that are more advanced com- pared to copy-pasting methods to text or image conversion, paraphrasing with the help of AI and manipulating content in a multi-modal way.",
    "Recent detailed researches carried out to evaluate 189 research articles show that close to 70 percent of the students use evasion mechanisms/techniques that can circumvent conventional detection mechanisms.",
    "As the level of text-editing tools and big language models has developed, the issue of plagiarism has become more complicated.",
    "The recent tricks adopted by students include text to alternative format, hand written text, text concealment, AI-assisted paraphrasing and slight semantic changes, to elude detection.",
    "This means that the detection rates of traditional plagiarism detectors may reduce to up to 45% when it must deal with these multi-layered evasion tactics.",
    "The problem is also enhanced by the development of generative AI at a high pace.",
    "Although such technologies may immensely improve creativity and productivity, they also create the content that is closely related to real human writing and it is much more difficult to differentiate between original and machine written work.",
    "This blurring of the lines calls for detection systems that can distinguish between traditional plagiarism and content produced by artificial intelligence.",
    "1.2  Problem Statement and Research Gap\nExisting plagiarism detection systems have severe limitations that are addressed in this review.",
    "One main shortcoming is format vulnerability, whereby systems are largely powerless against text placed in images so that detection is easily evaded with a simple change of format.",
    "This is augmented by limitations of OCR technology, as the majority of systems use old recognition algorithms that perform poorly with handwriting, noisy images, or complicated layouts.",
    "Additionally, most commercial checkers have shallow analysis, tending to concentrate principally on shallow textual similarity without the more in-depth semantic analysis needed for successful paraphrase detection.",
    "The advent of generative AI has brought about a new frontier of AI-content blindness, with synthetic plagiarism evading traditional systems with 73% failure rates [4].",
    "Cross- language issues also remain, since machine translation tools drive a type of plagiarism that is weakly tackled by existing technologies.",
    "Although solutions to each of these issues are isolated, a considerable gap is left for an integrated, multi- modal system which harmoniously couples strong OCR with cutting-edge NLP and state-of-the-art AI-detection for bracing against these linked weaknesses together.",
    "This paper seeks to bridge this major gap by giving an overview and scheming such an integrated system.",
    "CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE SURVEY\nCHAPTER 2 LITERATURE SURVEY\nEvolution of Plagiarism Detection Technologies\nPlagiarism detection has evolved significantly from basic string-matching algorithms to modern semantic frameworks.",
    "Early tools employed Rabin-Karp and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms, effective for direct copy-paste detection but failing against paraphrasing and structural modifications.",
    "Statis- tical techniques like n-gram matching, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity provided broader coverage but remained vulnerable to synonym replacement and sentence reordering.",
    "Since 2018, a major shift toward AI-driven techniques has occurred.",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformer-based models like BERT and GPT are examples of deep learning models that have taken plagiarism detection to the semantic level.",
    "Such models are able to understand the context and meaning, and, therefore, are much more effective and resistant to advanced evasion methods.",
    "Optical Character Recognition Advances\nThe technology of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has come a long way, as it is no longer template-based but features advanced methods of deep learning.",
    "Early OCR systems were template based and used statistical techniques that were only moderately accurate on printed text but were largely inaccurate with handwritten text.",
    "The current OCR systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved a maximum processing ac- curacy of up to 96.7% on printed text and approximately 87% on handwritten text.",
    "More recent transformer architectures, like TrOCR, integrated vision and language transformers to Charlotte the complex architecture of documents, multilingual text, and degraded images in a more effective way [8].",
    "They have been useful in practice as automated data ex- traction in PDF, analysis of clinical reports, and others, where OCR is used with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret scanned documents into structured and usable information [9].",
    "More advancement in image preprocessing with noise reduction, binarizing and image enhancement methods has also led to enhanced recognition accuracy [10].",
    "Natural Language Processing Integration\nA key role in increasing the capabilities of plagiarism detection has been played by the advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, which do not just match words.",
    "Transformer models (e.g.",
    "BERT, RoBERTa, GPT) offer contextual explanation and therefore, detection systems are much more resilient towards paraphrasing and synonym-based attacks [6].",
    "The embedding models developed at OpenAI have demonstrated good performance in sentence level similarity identification, but more traditional algorithms like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText can be still utilized to provide an efficient base in lightweight processing [11].",
    "Even more sophisticated methods such as Doc2Vec enhance even more the ability to capture sentence-level semantics.",
    "In addition to embeddings, other linguistic analysis tools such as semantic role labelling, dependency parsing, and discourse analysis also allow the detection of conceptual plagiarism, in which there are concepts being reused but text is not duplicated directly [12].",
    "Moreover, semantic and thematic similarities are further emphasized by graph-based neural networks, which are used to model the semantic relationships of whole documents.",
    "AI-Generated Content Detection\nPlagiarism detection has become a problem with the emergence of large language models.",
    "AI-Catcher tools and other tools combining Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been found to be highly accurate in detecting the presence of AI-generated academic text [13].The studies show that AI-generated text has language fingerprints, which are highly discernible using finely-tuned models.",
    "Such benchmark datasets as AIGText offer instances of human-written, AI-generated, and hybrid texts to allow a systematic analysis of detection systems [14].",
    "The conventional approaches to statistics are concerned with feature engineering and classification through stylistic features [15].",
    "More complex such methods as linguistic fingerprinting examine linguistic clues such as sentence composition, vocabulary usage, and measures of coherence to distinguish machine-generated text and human work [16].",
    "New tools in the perplexity analysis and burstiness detection demonstrate a specific potential in detecting advanced AI-generated content.",
    "Multi-model Content Analysis\nAccording to recent studies, multi-modal plagiarism detection (combining textual, visual, and structural) is currently important.",
    "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are the system of analysis that provides a universal platform in the analysis of various types of content [17].",
    "Perceptual hashing, feature extraction, and deep learning similarity models are some of the methods used to address image-based plagiarism [18].",
    "There are cross-modal detectors, which are meant to identify instances where a text is masquerading as a picture or hand written work roberts2024cross.",
    "Their practical application could be seen in automated evaluation of answer scripts which proves the effectiveness of multi-modal analysis in educational institutions [20].",
    "These methods provide a great deal of enhancement to text-only systems, especially in dealing with a variety of submission formats.",
    "CHAPTER3: SYSTEM DESIGN & ANALYSIS\nCHAPTER3\nSYSTEM DESIGN & ANALYSIS\n3.1  Commercial Systems Analysis\nFig.",
    "1.",
    "Commercial Systems Analysis\nIn summary of our analysis of commercial plagiarism detectors, in Table I, the accuracy of the tools is 73-81% in standard text, but the tools have significant weaknesses.",
    "The overall performance decreases by up to 45 percent on image- embedded content or on handwritten content and the chances of AI-generated text going undetected is high and failure rates can reach to 73% [4].",
    "The absence of combined multi-modal processing is one of the major limitations.",
    "TABLE I COMMERCIAL PLAGIARISM DETECTION SYSTEMS\n3.2  Research Systems Evaluation\nResearch-based on the challenging areas of detection has examined the promising strategies in some of the challenges.",
    "The systems with OCR improvements show the possibility of obtaining up to 94% accuracy in scanned documents with combined OCR-NLP pipelines, but not all implementations have extensive similarity analysis features.",
    "Knowledge graph- based semantic analysis models and transformer-based models have a high potential in identifying conceptual plagiarism, which rereads or reformats information.",
    "3.3  Gap Analysis and Research Opportunities\nAlthough scholarly studies have resulted in new solutions, these have been disjointed.",
    "OCR enriched systems can extract texts with 94 percent accuracy [20] and transformers-based semantic analysis can detect paraphrases with accuracy [21].",
    "The cross-modal frameworks allow a unified analysis, which is based on cross-modal [19], and dedicated AI detectors report 87 percent accuracy in controlled settings [13].",
    "Yet, the majority of these solutions are proof-of-concept and do not have the scalability and integration to be used in practice.",
    "CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSION\nCHAPTER4\nCONCLUSION\n4.1 Conclusion\nFuture academic integrity tools will also require being more confidential, streamlined and flexible.",
    "That change indicates the rate in which learning is becoming more dynamic, and takes on more and more content, such as coding tasks on a given assignment or a multimedia project, and continues to make the safety of our personal information an ongoing concern.",
    "The greatest difficulty we have is how to develop systems that will accommodate all this creativity work in the entire campus and maintain privacy at a tight level.",
    "We have already gotten our first foot in the door which may be a good one today, and also which may place us in a position to walk in the right direction into tomorrow.",
    "After all, it is not only about the detection of plagiarism.",
    "We are trying to enhance creativity, draw out originality and enhance the entire atmosphere surrounding academic honesty.",
    "4.2 Future Scope\nThe development of plagiarism detectors is based on the tech progress, coverage, and morality.",
    "Technologically, we require the tools which do not merely text, but realistically understand media, pictures, sounds and video.",
    "It is about transparency, it is also big; we must know how these systems make decisions.",
    "The federated learning is a cool method that allows models to learn without compromising the privacy of the student data.",
    "It is a game changer: we do not have to simply mark the plagiarism once it has happened, we can provide assistance during the creative process in real time.",
    "We also require the detectors that will be able to recognize the originality in all its varieties- in code, mathematics proofs, and even VR projects.",
    "The largest one, but still, the most important is that as these techs become stronger, we should consider the social and moral consequences.",
    "Equity in languages, societies and fields must be the number one priority.",
    "Ultimately, we do not seek to spy on students, simply to make an educational buddy, which enhances creativity, maintains high standards of integrity and makes learning more efficient.",
