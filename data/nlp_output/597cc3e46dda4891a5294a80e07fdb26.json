    "3.6 Functional Expectations of the System\nFrom a functional perspective, the system is expected to handle a wide range of academic submission formats.",
    "It must process digital text, scanned images, handwritten documents, and mixed-format files without requiring manual intervention.",
    "The system should automatically determine the appropriate processing steps based on input characteristics.",
    "The system must also perform effective text preprocessing, including normalization, cleaning, and linguistic analysis.",
    "This ensures consistency in downstream processing and reduces noise introduced by OCR errors or formatting variations.",
    "Feature extraction must capture both lexical and semantic information to support robust similarity analysis.",
    "Additionally, the system must incorporate mechanisms to detect AI-generated content.",
    "This involves analyzing writing patterns, statistical properties, and language consistency to identify characteristics commonly associated with machine-generated text.",
    "3.7 Quality and Performance Requirements\nBeyond functional capabilities, the system must satisfy several quality requirements.",
    "Detection accuracy is a primary concern, as false negatives undermine academic integrity and false positives unfairly penalize students.",
    "The system must achieve a balance between sensitivity and precision.",
    "Scalability is another critical requirement.",
    "Academic institutions often process large volumes of submissions within short timeframes.",
    "The system must handle such workloads efficiently without significant performance degradation.",
